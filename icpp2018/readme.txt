These experiments were executed to assess the performance of the Packdrop scheduler. Hence, the scheduler policy was tested in the Charm++ version 6.8.1 as an integrated load balancer strategy. In order to exploit different levels of parallelism in face of platform level, the following environments were selected to execute the tests: (i) Nancy cluster on the France's Grid5000 grid and (ii) the brazillian grid Santos Dumont. Each platform was configured as enumerated:

Nancy experiments:
  - Compiler version: gcc v5.4
  - Interconnect: gigabit
  - Experiment Size:
    - 128 PEs on 32 nodes

Santos Dumont experiments:
  - Compiler version: gcc v5.3.1
  - Interconnect: MPI v3.1
